//! OS keychain wrapper. Fronts `keyring::Entry` so call sites don't
//! deal with the cross-platform quirks (Windows Credential Manager
//! vs macOS Keychain vs Linux D-Bus Secret Service) directly.
//!
//! The keychain protects values at the OS-user level — the calling
//! process gains access transparently while the user is logged in.
//! That's the right boundary for the RSI session cookie: only the
//! same OS user that pasted the cookie can read it back. The cookie
//! never leaves the machine in plaintext form; the tray reads it
//! out of here, attaches it to the local-only fetch against
//! `robertsspaceindustries.com`, and forwards only the parsed
//! hangar payload up to the StarStats server.
//!
//! `SecretStore` is parameterised by account name so the same
//! wrapper can hold other per-user secrets later (OAuth refresh
//! tokens, etc) without forking the abstraction.
