//! SpiceDB authorization client foundation.
//!
//! StarStats uses SpiceDB (Zanzibar-style ReBAC) for cross-user
//! permission decisions. The schema lives at `infra/spicedb/schema.zed`
//! and is applied separately via the `zed` CLI; this module is a
//! thin client wrapper that the server uses at request time.
//!
//! ## Posture
//! - [`SpicedbClient::connect`] is async and may fail if the sidecar
//!   is unreachable. Callers should treat that as **degraded mode** —
//!   log a warning and continue without SpiceDB rather than fail boot.
//! - [`SpicedbClient::ping`] performs a real round-trip (read schema)
//!   so `/readyz` can flag a misconfigured deployment.
//! - [`SpicedbClient::check_permission`] wraps `CheckPermission` and
//!   returns a `bool`. Conditional / caveated permissions are reported
//!   as deny — the StarStats schema does not currently use caveats.
//!
//! ## Why this crate
//! `spicedb-client` (v0.1) wraps the auto-generated `spicedb-grpc`
//! types behind an ergonomic `SpicedbClient`. It pins `tonic 0.12`,
//! which already lives in our dep tree via `opentelemetry-otlp`. The
//! alternative — vendoring `tonic-build` + the `authzed/api` protos —
//! is significantly more wiring for the same surface area we need.
