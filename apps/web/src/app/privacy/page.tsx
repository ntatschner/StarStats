            AES-256-GCM under a key held in a file outside the

            event is meaningful to you. We don&apos;t build a
            profile of that second person — they appear only when
            they intersected with your gameplay, and only the

            record is removed; your ingested events are pseudonymised

          StarStats is not directed at children under 13 (under 16
          in some EU jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect
          data from anyone under that age. If you believe a child
          has created an account, contact us and we will remove it.

          We do not perform automated decision-making or profiling
          that produces legal or similarly significant effects on
          you. Stats and timelines are descriptive aggregations of
          events you uploaded — no scoring, ranking against other
          users, or eligibility decisions are made.

          Passwords are hashed with Argon2id. Sessions are HttpOnly +
          Secure cookies with a 1-hour TTL. The API uses RS256 JWTs
          signed by a key generated on the server. All ingress is
          served over HTTPS with HSTS. Database connections require
          TLS in our production deployment. Access to the
          deployment&apos;s underlying infrastructure is limited to
          the project maintainer.

          Two-factor authentication (optional). If you enable it, we
          store your TOTP shared secret encrypted with AES-256-GCM
          under a key held in a file outside the database, with a
          fresh nonce per encryption. Recovery codes are stored only
          as Argon2 hashes — we can verify a code you give us but
          cannot read it back. Disabling 2FA wipes both the secret
          and the recovery-code rows.

          Magic-link and 2FA flows use single-use, short-lived
          interim tokens (15 minutes for magic links, 5 minutes for
          the post-password 2FA token); a leaked link or interim
          token without the matching second factor is useless on
          its own. Failed sign-in attempts are timing-equalised to
          avoid revealing whether a Comm-Link maps to an account.

          72 hours of becoming aware, in line with Art. 33 / 34.
