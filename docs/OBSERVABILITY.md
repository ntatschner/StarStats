# Observability

Four orthogonal telemetry planes. They share infrastructure but have
different storage, retention, and access semantics.

| Plane | What | Backend | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Logs** | "What happened" — structured events from every service | Loki | 30 days |
| **Metrics** | "How often / how fast" — numeric time series | Prometheus | 15 days |
| **Traces** | "Where did time go" — distributed spans across services | Tempo | 7 days |
| **Audit** | "Who did what to which resource" — tamper-evident | Postgres `audit_log` + Loki + MinIO Object Lock | 7 years |
| **Crashes** | Stack traces, breadcrumbs, release health | GlitchTip | 90 days |

All emitters speak **OpenTelemetry**. The OTEL Collector is the single
ingest point; backends are pluggable behind it.

## Per-component matrix

| Component | Logs | Metrics | Traces | Audit | Crashes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tray client (Tauri) | local rolling JSON; opt-in OTLP export | local counters; tray Status pane | opt-in OTLP | local JSONL for cookie/account changes | GlitchTip Rust SDK (opt-in) |
| starstats-core (lib) | tracing events | metrics counters | `#[instrument]` spans | (n/a) | (caller handles) |
| starstats-api (Axum) | stdout JSON → OTEL → Loki | `axum-prometheus` `/metrics` → Prometheus | tracing-opentelemetry → OTEL → Tempo | `audit_log` table (hash-chained) → Loki + MinIO | GlitchTip Rust SDK |
| starstats-web (Next.js) | pino JSON stdout → OTEL → Loki; browser → GlitchTip | `prom-client` → Prometheus; Web Vitals → OTEL | `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` → OTEL → Tempo | (delegated to API) | GlitchTip browser + server SDK |
| Postgres | stdout → OTEL filelog → Loki; pgaudit | `postgres_exporter` → Prometheus | (sqlx instrumentation in callers) | pgaudit + `audit_log` table | (n/a) |
| Authentik | stdout → Loki | `/-/health/ready/` polling | (n/a — Python service) | built-in event store | (n/a) |
| SpiceDB | stdout → Loki | `:9090/metrics` → Prometheus | OTLP → Tempo | WatchAPI stream → `audit_log` | (n/a) |
| MinIO | stdout → Loki; bucket audit webhook | `/minio/v2/metrics/cluster` → Prometheus | OTLP support → Tempo | bucket audit → `audit_log`; Object Lock | (n/a) |
| Traefik | access log file → Loki | (existing exporter pattern) | passthrough `traceparent` | (n/a) | (n/a) |
| OTEL Collector | self stdout → Loki (avoiding loops via filelog exclude) | `:8888/metrics` → Prometheus | (gateway) | (n/a) | (n/a) |

## Trace propagation

Every HTTP request carries a `traceparent` header per W3C Trace
Context. Tray client → API → SpiceDB → Postgres queries — one trace
ID spans the whole flow.

```
[tray client]   trace=abc123
     │ HTTPS, traceparent: 00-abc123-...
     ▼
[starstats-api] root span
     │ instruments sqlx + spicedb client
     ├─▶ [postgres]  child span via sqlx
     └─▶ [spicedb]   child span via tonic
```

Grafana joins traces↔logs by `trace_id` so you can click from a slow
request straight to its log lines, and from a log line to the
request that produced it.

## Metric naming

OpenTelemetry semantic conventions. Examples:

- `http.server.request.duration` (histogram, ms) — every API request
- `http.server.active_requests` (gauge) — current concurrency
- `db.client.connections.usage` (gauge) — sqlx pool
- `starstats.events.ingested` (counter) — events accepted
- `starstats.events.rejected` (counter) with attribute `reason=…` — events refused
- `starstats.sync.lag.seconds` (histogram) — client→server delay
- `starstats.spicedb.check.duration` (histogram) — permission checks

Per-tenant cardinality control: never label by `user_id` or `org_id`
in metrics; use them only in logs and traces.

## Log discipline

- **Structured JSON only**, one event per line.
- **Use levels honestly**: `error` for things a human must investigate,
  `warn` for self-recovering anomalies, `info` for state changes,
  `debug` for diagnostic detail (off in prod by default).
- **Never log secrets**, raw tokens, RSI cookies, password hashes.
  Use `tracing::field::Empty` and `record()` to redact.
- **Include `trace_id` and `span_id`** in every log line. Both
  `tracing-subscriber` (Rust) and `pino` (Node) wire this automatically
  when OTEL is configured.
- **Include `request_id`** generated at the edge (Traefik or first
  Axum middleware) for cases where there is no trace.

## Alert seeds

To wire into Grafana later — these belong in
`infra/prometheus/alerts.yml` once Phase 5 (production hardening)
lands:

- API p99 latency > 500ms for 5m
- API 5xx rate > 1% for 5m
- Postgres connection pool saturation > 80% for 5m
- MinIO bucket size > 80% of disk
- Loki ingester back-pressure
- SpiceDB authoritative reads p99 > 50ms
- audit_log write lag > 30s (mirror to Loki broken)

Don't ship these before there's enough signal to set thresholds
honestly. Premature alerting is worse than none.
